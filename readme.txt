This repo is a work in progress of using a CNN model to classify audio data.  Signal processing is done to visualize and feature engineer the raw wav files.  By creating pitch sifts, MFCC transformations and other audio transformations we can create multiple dimentions of data and train a more robust model.

In the future I hope to develop this code into a tuner by training the classification model on generated notes.
